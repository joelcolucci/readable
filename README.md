```
# Clone repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/joelcolucci/readable.git

# CD into the project directory

The repository contains an api-server and a separate frontend build.

Each have their own dependencies that will need to be installed.

### Install api-server dependencies:
```
# CD into the api-server directory from the project root
cd api-server

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

### Install frontend dependencies:
```
# CD into the frontend directory from the project root
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

## Getting started
This project requires starting two processes to run. One for the api-server and one for the frontend build.

### In a terminal window:
```
# CD into the api-server directory from the project root
cd api-server

# Start the api-server
node server.js
```

### In a second terminal window:
```
# CD into the frontend directory from the project root
cd frontend

# Start the frontend
yarn start
```

A browser tab should automatically open and load the app.
